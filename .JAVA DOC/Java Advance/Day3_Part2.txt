jsp
```
   java server pages
   
   
   
->jsp is also a technology given by sunmicrosystem

->implementations are provided by server vendors

->tomcat server -> server container



    servlet container->it is responsible to process all the servlet classes
	jsp container -> it is responsible to process all the jsp pages
	ejb container
	jsf container
	
->interfaces

 implementations are provided by  server vendors
   
 how these implementations are availabe in the server?
 
    in the form of jar files
	
	 for the servlet -> servlet-api.jar
	 for the jsp -> jsp-api.jar
	
	 
	 
purpose of servlet --> to develop dynamic web pages

purpose of jsp --> to develop dynamic web pages

	drawbacks of servlet:
	
	  1.not recommended to have both  business logic + presentation logic in single servlet class
	  2.java knowledge is required to write the servlet class for non java 
	    programmers understanding the servlet is very much typical who has
		no knowledge on core java.
		
	  3.everytime restart the server to make changes affected.
	  
	  
jsp:
```
 1. jsp is  a tag based programming language
 
 2. inside the jsp we also can write html tags + jsp tags
 
 3. non it programmers can easily understand this jsp technology
 
 4. we no need to restart the server just by resending the request
    automatically changes gets affected.
	
	
in jsp technology, we do have three types of tags

   1.scritpting tags/elements

   2.directive tags/elements

   3.action tags/elements


scripting tags:
```````````````

purpose: to insert the java code in jsp page.


   scripting tags can be again segarated into three types.
     
	    1.scriptlet element
		2.expression element
		3.declarative eleemnt
		
		
1..scriptlet element:

  syntax:  
 
        <%  
                 //java code
         %>		
   
   
 where did you keep our jsp files?
 
   under webapp folder
   
 what is the extension for our jsp files?
 
   <filename>.jsp
   
   
 when we run the jsp file, jsp page is completely translated into 
 equivalent servlet class.
 
 
 out -> JspWriter is the class which is extends from PrintWriter
 
 out -> impliticit object of JspWriter 
   
   
     9 implicit objects
	 
	 out,request,response,application,page,exception,...
	 
example of scriptlet tag:
``````````````````````````
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
    pageEncoding="ISO-8859-1"%>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
<title>Insert title here</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>welcome to jsp technology from sopra using html tag</h1>
  
  <br/>
  
 
  
   <%--scriptlet tag --%>
  <%
  out.println("<h1>");
  out.println("welcome to jsp technology from sopra using jsp scriptlet tag");
  out.println("</h1>");
  %>
</body>
</html>

expression tag:
````````````````
syntax:

   <%= 

      //java code
   %> 
   
example:
`````````
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
    pageEncoding="ISO-8859-1"%>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
<title>Insert title here</title>
</head>
<body>

<%--expression tag --%>

<h1>
 <%=
 
 "welcome to jsp using expression tag" 
 
 
 %>
 
 </h1>

</body>
</html>



declarative tag:
`````````````````

 if we want to declare any variables or to define methods 
 we should use declarative tag.

syntax:

   <%!

    //declare the variable or
    // define the method
   %>
   
 example:
 
   <%!
     int a= 100;
	 void m1()
	 {
	 
	 }
    
	%>

class _ScriptLet
{

     int a= 100;
	 void m1()
	 {
	 
	 }
   
  _jspService()
  {
     
  }
  
}


note:
````
using scirptlet or expression we can declare the variable but we cannot
define the method.

using declarative tag, we can declare the variables and we can 
define the methods too.

example:
`````````
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
    pageEncoding="ISO-8859-1"%>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
<title>Insert title here</title>
</head>
<body>

<%!
  int a=100;
  int square(int x)
  {
	 return x*x; 
  }

%>


<%

out.println("a value is : " +a);
int x = square(5);
out.println("<br/>");
out.println("square value is: " + x);

%> 
</body>
</html>

scripting tags,directive tags, action tags 
  -scriptlet tags
  -expression tag
  -declarative tag
  
  
directive tags:
```````````````
purpose:
````````

    ->include directive
	->page directive
	->taglib directive(custom tags)
